/-- The `Assignment` inductive datatype is used in the `assignments` field of default formulas (defined in
    Formula.Implementation.lean) to store and quickly access information about whether unit literals are
    contained in (or entailed by) a formula.

    The elements of `Assignment` can be viewed as a lattice where `both` is top, satisfying both `hasPosAssignment`
    and `hasNegAssignment`, `pos` satisfies only the former, `neg` satisfies only the latter, and `unassigned` is
    bottom, satisfying neither. If one wanted to modify the default formula structure to use a BitArray rather than
    an `Assignment Array` for the `assignments` field, a reasonable 2-bit representation of the `Assignment` type
    would be:
    - both: 11
    - pos: 10
    - neg: 01
    - unassigned: 00

    Then `hasPosAssignment` could simply query the first bit and `hasNegAssignment` could simply query the second bit. -/
