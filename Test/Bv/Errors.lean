error: None of the hypotheses are in the supported BitVec fragment.
There are two potential fixes for this:
1. If you are using custom BitVec constructs simplify them to built-in ones.
2. If your problem is using only built-in ones it might currently be out of reach.
   Consider expressing it in terms of different operations that are better supported.
